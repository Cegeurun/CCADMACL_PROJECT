Unsupervised Segmentation of Video Game Metadata for Quality Estimation  

## **A. Project Overview**

The main goal of this project is to implement an unsupervised learning framework to automatically segment video games into distinct, meaningful archetypes such as "Critically Acclaimed Blockbusters" or "Underrated Gems" by analyzing the latent patterns between their commercial performance (global sales) and critical reception (critic and user scores). This topic is interesting as it moves beyond simple review aggregates to discover how success and quality interact in the gaming industry, providing a data-driven lens on what constitutes a "worthwhile" game. We hope to discover whether high critic scores consistently align with commercial success, how user-critic discrepancies define unique game clusters, and ultimately provide a novel, metadata-driven method for estimating video game quality and market positioning.
