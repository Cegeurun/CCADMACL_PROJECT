A final project requirement for our "Advanced Machine Learning" course.

## Video Game Clustering: Unsupervised Learning Framework

### Project Overview

This project implements an unsupervised learning framework to automatically segment video games into distinct, meaningful archetypes by analyzing patterns between commercial performance (global sales) and critical reception (critic and user scores).

**Key Objectives:**
- Discover game archetypes like "Critically Acclaimed Blockbusters" and "Underrated Gems"
- Analyze correlation between commercial success and critical quality
- Understand user-critic discrepancies across different game types
- Provide data-driven insights for game quality and market positioning

### Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Video Game Sales with Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings/data)

**Key Features:**
- Commercial metrics: Global sales, regional sales
- Quality metrics: Critic scores, user scores
- Metadata: Game name, platform, genre, release year

### Methodology

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Remove games with l success?  
✓ How do user-critic discrepancies define unique game clusters?  
✓ What patterns exist between quality and sales in the gaming industry?  
✓ Can unsupervised learning discover "hidden gems"?
